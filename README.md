# Zhihu-Daily-For-Practice
This is program using Zhihu API writting with Laravel5.2
----

- The API return html data,so we should use regular expression to get the value from body

- If you use the origin image url of the json data, you can't get the exact image because of the hotlink protection

> you can handle the problem by replacing the image url of https://images.weserv.nl/url=(image url)
